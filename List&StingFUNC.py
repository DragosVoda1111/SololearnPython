# STRING FORMATING
"""

Strings have a format() function, which enables values to be embedded in it, using placeholders.

Example:"""

nums = [4,5,6]
msg = "Numbers: {0} {1} {2}". format(nums[0],nums[1],nums[2])        #Each argument of the format function is placed in the string at the corresponding position,
                                                                      # which is determined using the curly braces { }.
print(msg)



#You can also name the placeholders, instead of the index numbers.


str="{c}, {b}, {a}".format(a=5, b=9, c=7)
print(str)



"""
Another lightning round! Here are some of the other useful string functions:

join - joins a list of strings with another string as a separator.

replace - replaces one substring in a string with another.

startswith and endswith - determine if there is a substring at the start and end of a string, respectively.

lower and upper â€“ changes the case of a string

split -the opposite of join, turns a string with a certain separator into a list.
Here they are in action:"""


print(", ".join(["spam", "eggs", "ham"]))
#prints "spam, eggs, ham"

print("Hello ME".replace("ME", "world"))
#prints "Hello world"

print("This is a sentence.".startswith("This"))
# prints "True"

print("This is a sentence.".endswith("sentence."))
# prints "True"

print("This is a sentence.".upper())
# prints "THIS IS A SENTENCE."

print("AN ALL CAPS SENTENCE".lower())
#prints "an all caps sentence"

print("spam, eggs, ham".split(", "))
#prints "['spam', 'eggs', 'ham']"
